                        Taking feedback from many users and personal experiences we have added new features, improved exciting features, upgraded the backend and frontend to

                            <p>
                                We have added multiple builder types to fit your needs. Some just need a quick and simple animation, while others might need a more custom and explicit animation.
                                By adding builder types we are not limiting those with extensive customizations and at the same time we are not over complicating the process for those looking for
                                something simple and quick.

                            <p>
                                This feature allows you to see the changes you are making to the hiden portion of the animation by making it appear on the screen while you edit it, so you don't have to manually
                                trigger it each time by hovering over.
                            </p>

                                In the pass the opacity setting was only meant to be used with a handful of effects. We have changed how this feature is applied to allow it to be used in every single
                                effect and transition.
                            </p>

                                We have enhanced and simplified the responsive feature. Now you can choose more options to compliment your responsive animation, such as gutters, whether or not you wish to
                                preserve the ratio when resizing, and we added a more comprehensive layout with upto 6 columns.
